JuSaber is a Jubeat clone built for keyboard with the ability to read
Beat Saber map files. At the moment, it will only play the hardest difficulty
found within a folder, difficulty selection is not enabled.

To add Beat Saber maps to the game, insert the map folder into
Assets/StreamingAssets/CustomSongs/. For example, if you were to add Believer,
the folder structure would be
Assets/StreamingAssets/CustomSongs/Believer/info.json,
Assets/StreamingAssets/CustomSongs/Believer/Expert.json,
Assets/StreamingAssets/CustomSongs/Believer/song.ogg,
etc.
