To add Beat Saber maps to the game, insert the map folder into this folder.
For example, if you were to add Believer, the folder structure would be
Assets/StreamingAssets/CustomSongs/Believer/info.json,
Assets/StreamingAssets/CustomSongs/Believer/Expert.json,
Assets/StreamingAssets/CustomSongs/Believer/song.ogg,
etc.
